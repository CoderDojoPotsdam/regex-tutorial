<p>
  Sometimes parts of words change, for example capital letters at the beginning of sentences.
  The changing part is put into braces.
  The fix part is outside of the braces.
  This way, you can cover several spellings with sets.
</p>
<p>
  An example: <span class="regex">[tT]he</span> matches
  <span class="regex">the</span> and <span class="regex">The</span>.
  The capital and the small T are between the braces to find upper and lower case spelling.
  Now, find the word <span class="regex">you</span> at the beginning and middle of the sentence
  by using <span class="regex">[yY]</span>.
</p>
<p class="hint">
  You can find the braces next to the Enter key on the right side of the keyboard.
</p>
<div class="playfield">
  <input type="text" value="" class="regex" reference="[yY]ou">
  <div class="message"></div>
  <ul class="examples">
    <li>You can find the</li>
    <li>braces if you</li>
    <li>click through the keys</li>
    <li>next to the</li>
    <li>"Enter" key on</li>
    <li>the right side of the keyboard.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
