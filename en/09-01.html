  You can combine characters and expressions to one expression by writing them between
  round brackets <span class="regex">(</span> and <span class="regex">)</span>.
  Repetitions which are located right behind the bracket <span class="regex">)</span>
  refer to the whole expression inside the brackets.
</p>
<p>
  There was an example where <span class="regex">a</span> appears twice of four times.
  Using brackets, you can match all even appearances of <span class="regex">a</span>.
</p>
<div class="playfield">
  <input type="text" value="^aa+$" class="regex" reference="^(aa)+$">
  <div class="message"></div>
  <ul class="examples">
    <li>a</li>
    <li>aa</li>
    <li>aaa</li>
    <li>aaaa</li>
    <li>aaaaa</li>
    <li>aaaaaa</li>
    <li>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</li>
    <li>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p class="hint">
  If you add brackets around <span class="regex">aa</span>,
  not <span class="regex">a</span> is repeated but <span class="regex">aa</span>.
  Thus, all lines mus contain an even number of <span class="regex">a</span>.
