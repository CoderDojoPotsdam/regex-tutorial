title: Predefined Character Sets
---
<p>
  Before, you could describe the set of all digits using <span class="regex">[0-9]</span>.
  Because some sets are used regularly, there are short notations for them.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="regex">\d</span> is the set of add <strong>d</strong>igits.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="regex">\s</span> is the set of all <strong>s</strong>paces, e.g. <span class="regex"> </span> or the line<br/>break.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="regex">.</span> matches all characters except the line break.
      <span class="regex">.*</span> can be used if you do not care about some content.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="regex">\w</span> is for letters in <strong>w</strong>ords.
      <span class="regex">\w</span> is the same as <span class="regex">[0-9a-zA-Z]_</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="regex">\\</span> matches the backslash <span class="regex">\</span>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Additionally, if you want to invert a set like <span class="regex">\s</span>,
  you can use the capital letter  e.g. <span class="regex">\S</span>.
