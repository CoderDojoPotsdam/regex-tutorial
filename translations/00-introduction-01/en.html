title: What can we use regular expressions for?
---
<p>
  With reglar expressions you can search through texts.
  A regular expression is a pattern you want to find in the text.
  In many programming languages, programmers use regular expressions to search through text,
  test if the input of a program is correct and, check if the users made mistakes.
